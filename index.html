            <p id="next-to-photo">Hi! My name is Ginna, I am a proud mother of a 2 year old. But I am more than that! I have studied arts and Graphic
            Design in the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. I studied there for about 3 years and then moved to the United States of America.
            Since then I have been working in the customer service field for more than 5 years, this experience has given me a lot of
            interpersonal skills. Now I am eager to start a career in web development. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="break">My passion for web development started when I realize how creative I can be when designing web pages and mobile apps. 
            Eye catching and interactive web pages and apps get most attention and so forth more visitors that will turn into customers. 
            </p>
          
            <p>Count with me to help you and your business to have the most eye catching and interactive web page and 
            apps that your customers will love!
